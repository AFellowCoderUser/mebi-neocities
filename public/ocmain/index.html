        <p>Here is where I'll keep information of my original characters! This page will mainly focus on the four projects I have that are in the making, but I'll be also including some side OCs which don't belong in any of the four projects.</p>

A dedicated profile page for each character will be made sometime in the future. Also, don't mind the TF2 Heavy, I just needed a square image placeholder.</p>
