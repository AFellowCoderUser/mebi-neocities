            Benny is just your average guy. He has a life that some others see as mildly boring, but normal to him (like almost everybody). He usually sticks to his usual schedule and barely makes any alternations to his schedule, although he does frequently meet his friends, head on to downtown, do shopping, or maybe all three at once. Benny is a very chill guy, not a lot bothers him and he's very easy going. Benny is not mad very frequently, but more frequent compared to once of his friends, <a href="/ocmain/nix">Nix</a>. Benny often prefers to be alone sometimes when he's doing all of his favorite things, and when he's hanging out with others, he tries to join in and sometimes joke around.

          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Benny Collins was born in Ottawa, Ontario on January 06, 2005. During his early school years, he was sometimes a bit troublesome in some situations, often spoiled and makes a fuss whenever things didn't go the way that he intended to. He was subject to being bullied at his school, sometimes avoiding them or just get into fights, although this wasn't very frequent. He was trouble to the school he goes to, his grades are low, and it seemed like success wasn't in his path. However, he was transferred to online school later on where he went through a dramatic change in personality. Once he returned going to school in person, he was a totally different person, now willing to take more risks, now accepts that things can change, and now generally a nice person. His school grades had also shot up.

          <h2>Moving out</h2>

            Benny would slowly become a prestigious student, aiming to learn more about technology and arts. He had dreamed of going to Aethepor and into its capital city, Oakshelf, where it is known for its good education. He had worked hard aiming for good grades, and finally the time has come. His parents and himself had rasied enough money to buy a plane ticket to Aethepor. Knowning that he'll not return back to his home country, he said goodbye to his teachers and friends and expressed his love for them and the school. A day later, he arrived at the airport where he waited for his flight; his luggage loaded, and very uncertain what to expect next. Eventually the boarding started, and he adjusted himself for the two flights to Aethepor. Finally he reached the capital city of Aethepor, Oakshelf. He quickly made his way to the exit after going through customs, where he was told that someone will be waiting for him there.
